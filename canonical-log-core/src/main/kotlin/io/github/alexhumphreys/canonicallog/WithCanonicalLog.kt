 * — the block returned (or threw), the adapter's `enrich` ran, and the threadlocal
 * has been restored. A throwing emit is a wiring bug at the entry-point level (the
 * canonical sink itself failed). The library does not attempt to recover: the
 * exception propagates out of `withCanonicalLog{,Blocking}` and replaces the block's
 * result. If the block had already thrown, the emit exception will replace *that*
 * (unhelpfully) — so keep emit implementations dead simple.

/**
 * Blocking entry point for opening a canonical work unit.

 * Lifecycle:
 *  1. Build a [CanonicalLogContext] from `adapter.describe(input)`.
 *  2. Install it as the current-thread canonical context.
 *  3. Run [block] with the context.
 *  4. Call `adapter.enrich` exactly once with the resulting [Outcome].
 *  5. Restore the previous threadlocal binding and call [emit] — both always run.
 *  6. Return the block's result, or rethrow its exception.
 *
 * Calling this inside an already-active work unit is **undefined**. Nested work
 * units are not yet supported (see CLAUDE.md). Calling it inside a coroutine
 * that does dispatcher switches is **undefined** for the inner switches —
 * the threadlocal is set on the entering thread only; coroutines that move to
 * other dispatchers won't see it. Use [withCanonicalLog] for suspend code, or
 * pair this with [withCanonicalCoroutineContext] inside the block.
 *
 * **Adapter exceptions:** `WorkUnitAdapter.enrich` is expected not to throw —
 * it's library-author code, not adopter code, and a throwing adapter is a bug.
 * As a defensive guarantee: if it does throw, the failure is recorded in the
 * canonical line itself via `canonical_log_enrich_error: true` and
 * `canonical_log_enrich_error_class: <fqcn>`. If the block succeeded, the enrich
 * exception propagates to the caller (something is genuinely broken). If the
 * block also threw, the block's exception wins; the enrich failure is captured
 * only via the marker fields on the canonical line.

 * means `async`, `launch`, and other [CoroutineScope] extensions called inside the
 * block resolve against the scope created by `withContext(CanonicalLogElement)`,
 * not against an outer scope (e.g. the test runner's `TestScope` or `runBlocking`'s
 * scope). Without the receiver, bare `async { ... }` inside the block silently
 * inherits the outer context, which has no canonical element, and contributions from
 * inside the async coroutine are lost.
 *
 * Calling this inside an already-active work unit is **undefined**. Nested work
 * units are not yet supported (see CLAUDE.md).
 *
 * **Threadlocal restoration:** unlike [withCanonicalLogBlocking], this variant does
 * not explicitly capture and restore a previous threadlocal binding around the block.
 * Restoration is delegated to the [CanonicalLogElement] `ThreadContextElement`
 * (`updateThreadContext`/`restoreThreadContext`), which is correct for the supported
 * case (a top-level entry from suspend code, where there is no prior threadlocal
 * binding on the dispatching thread). For the unsupported nested case, behaviour
 * diverges from the blocking variant — but nesting is undefined regardless.
 *
 * Adapter exception handling matches [withCanonicalLogBlocking].
