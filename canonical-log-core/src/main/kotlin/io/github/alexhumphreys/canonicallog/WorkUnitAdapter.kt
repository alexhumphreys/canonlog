/**
 * Translates between an entry-point's input type and the canonical work-unit lifecycle.
 *
 * One implementation per kind of entry point — HTTP requests, Kafka messages, scheduled
 * jobs, etc. The implementation captures what's mechanically uniform across every
 * invocation of that entry point: a request's method/route/status, a message's
 * topic/partition, and so on. Per-operation values (`post_id`, `comment_count`) are
 * the handler's job, not the adapter's.
 *
 * **Adapters must not throw.** Both [describe] and [enrich] are called by
 * `withCanonicalLog{,Blocking}` as part of the work-unit lifecycle, and a throwing
 * adapter is a bug. The library is defensive against it (a throwing [enrich] records
 * `canonical_log_enrich_error` on the canonical line and may propagate the exception),
 * but treat that as a backstop, not a contract — adapter implementations should
 * read inputs that are guaranteed-valid by their caller and write fields that are
 * guaranteed-formattable.
